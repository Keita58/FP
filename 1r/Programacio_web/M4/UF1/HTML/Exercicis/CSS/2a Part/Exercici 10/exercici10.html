<h1>SimCity</h1>
<p id="#primer">SimCity, also known as Micropolis or SimCity Classic,[3] is a city-building simulation video game developed by Will Wright, and released for several platforms from 1989 to 1991. </p>
<p>The core concept of SimCity is to build and design a city without specific goals to achieve. The player may divide land into commercial, industrial, or residential zones, add buildings, change the tax rate, build a power grid, build transportation systems and take any other actions to enhance the city. Once able to construct buildings in a particular area, the too-small-to-see residents, known as "Sims",[5] may choose to construct and upgrade houses, apartment blocks, light, heavy industrial buildings, commercial buildings, hospitals, churches, and other structures. </p>
